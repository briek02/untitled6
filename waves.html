    <p>
      A wave can be described as a disturbance that travels through a medium from one location
      to another location. Consider a slinky wave as an example of a wave. When the slinky is
      stretched from end to end and is held at rest, it assumes a natural position known as the
      equilibrium or rest position. The coils of the slinky naturally assume this position, spaced
      equally far apart. Please check the videos section for 2 videos related to waves.
